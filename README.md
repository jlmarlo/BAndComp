# BAndComp (**B**etter**An**notation **Comp**arison)

This workflow takes a VCF and annotates all variants present with three annotator programs: Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP), SnpEff, and ANNOVAR

Annotations are compared with a custom python script and report about annotation agreement is generated in the output directory.
