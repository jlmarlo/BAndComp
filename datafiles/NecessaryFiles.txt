These are the files that need to be in the datafiles directory for the program to work
VCF that has no annotation information. This is the VCF that will be annotated by all three programs
Reference files - the reference genome that was used in the creation of the VCF
The GTF file which will be used by VEP and ANNOVAR to annotate the file (needs a index file. Preferably should be a sorted gtf)
